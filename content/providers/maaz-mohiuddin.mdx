review: >
  I have been seeing Dr Maaz for a while now. I really like how he spends the
  time needed to understand the symptoms and provide an action plan to treat the
  illness. He doesn't rush the visits as I normally feel rushed with other
  doctors. In addition, he has great knowledge on new medicines and resources
  available for treating my illness and provides information on recent studies
  and what all my options are.

Providing relief to patients who have struggled with allergic disease is what drives me to be at the forefront of our field.

I trained in an environment where we saw the most challenging cases of atopic dermatitis (eczema), asthma, food allergies, and other allergic conditions in patients from all around the world. I was mentored by world renowned allergists, at National Jewish Health, who have written many of the guidelines we follow today. And despite being surrounded by the most advanced diagnostics and minds, I learned that spending time with the patient educating them about their disease and the treatments, ensuring proper technique, is what most often leads to drastic improvements in their quality of life.

My goal is that every patient leaves our office feeling empowered and involved in the decision making process of their health with no questions unanswered. I especially look forward to treating the most challenging cases in patients who have suffered too long with no relief despite multiple doctor visits.
