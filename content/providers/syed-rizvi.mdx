  I have been having medical issues for the past two months and seeing lots of
  doctors and I feel like Dr. Rizvi really listened to me. He was very kind and
  asked me if I had questions at the end! I felt like he really took the time
  with me and wasnâ€™t focused on anything else

I was born in Chicago and raised in Central Illinois. My first ambition in life was to become a garbage truck. Realizing that wasn't possible, I turned to his next big interest: allergies. After earning my medical degree from University of Medicine & Health Sciences, I completed pediatric residency at OSF St. Francis Medical Center/Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria, IL and then went on to Saint Louis University for my Allergy/Immunology fellowship.

Having lived with food and environmental allergies my entire life, I can truly empathize with my patients' day-to-day realities of living with allergies. I was once a patient of Dr Mohiuddin's myself so I know firsthand how much your life can improve by seeing a caring allergist and this is what I strive to emulate. My passion comes from helping complex and challenging cases and improving their quality of life.
