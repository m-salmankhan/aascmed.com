Living with eczema can be very frustrating. If you are living with eczema or know someone who is, you are not alone. Millions of Americans are living with eczema, or atopic dermatitis. The good news is that you have several treatment options available to help manage your symptoms and also restore comfort to your skin. At [**Allergy, Asthma, and Sinus Centers**](https://www.aascmed.com/), our mission is to help patients find relief and live with healthier skin. In this article, we will provide you with the best and most effective eczema treatment options and tell you what you need to know about these treatments.





### **Understanding Eczema**

Eczema goes beyond having dry skin. It is a chronic condition that leads to inflammation and irritation of the skin. Eczema can appear anywhere on the body. Eczema can affect people of any age, but it is most common among children. The causes of eczema are diverse, but they are usually the result of a mixture of hereditary, environmental, or immune responses. 





### **1- Moisturizers and Hydration** 

Adequately moisturizing the skin is important to minimize eczema flare-ups. Instead of letting dryness worsen symptoms, apply moisturizer. When selecting a moisturizer, use fragrance-free creams. Scented products that are alcohol-based may worsen a flare-up. You should apply your moisturizer from head to toe immediately upon exiting the bath/before drying off, as you will have lock moisture into your skin, which is hydrated. 





### **2. Topical Steroids**

For many individuals suffering from eczema, they can take comfort in knowing that over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams will assist with inflammation and itching during flare-ups. For more serious eczema symptoms, a doctor will prescribe topical corticosteroids.

These medications:

- Reduce redness and swelling. 
- Assist with skin healing with regard to a flare-up. 
- All medications must be used as indicated, mostly for short periods of time. 
- Avoid long-term use of steroids to thin the skin. 
- It’s important not to overuse steroids, as long-term use can thin the skin. Always follow your doctor’s instructions carefully.





### **3. Non-Steroid Prescription Creams**

There are also non-steroidal prescription treatments too. Below are examples of non-steroidal prescription treatments: 

- Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus. 

- Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors such as crisaborole. 

These medications suppress the immune system in the skin. They are useful for sensitive areas, such as the face or eyelids, and can be used for longer than steroids. 





### **4. Antihistamines** 

Antihistamines, although they will not treat eczema, can minimize itching at night. This allows the skin to stay intact and promotes better sleep. Better sleep will minimize scratching and further damage to the skin, allowing repair to occur. Sedating antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) are often used at nighttime but we would recommend consulting your doctor before you begin using them regularly.   





### **5. Phototherapy** 

Phototherapy is also called light therapy, because it uses specific types of light to expose the skin at intervals under medical supervision. This treatment is effective for people with eczema that do not respond to creams and/or have an extensive area of eczema. 

At the **Allergy, Asthma, and Sinus Centers**, we frequently recommend phototherapy for:

- Moderate-to-severe eczema 
-  Patients who want to minimize drug options
- Individuals with frequent flares 

By reducing inflammation, light therapy improves skin health over long periods of time. It typically requires several days per week for several months.





### **6. Biologic Treatments**

In the past few years, biologic drugs have opened up another avenue of hope for patients with severe eczema, specifically created to modulate the immune system and halt inflammation at the source. The biologic most commonly prescribed for eczema, dupilumab, is an injection given every two weeks, and it is important to note the number of patients it has been able to assist where all other modalities of treatment have failed.

**Biologic therapies:**

- Are only prescribed when other therapies have not been successful
- Are safe for long-term use under doctor's supervision, 

Can reduce flare-up frequency and itch in dramatically different ways.

This option is usually pursued when the eczema is significantly affecting an individual's quality of life and health.





### **7. Lifestyle and Home Remedies**

There are a lot of lifestyle habits that might provide a good foundation for managing eczema (all of these can work to add to your medical treatment):

- Take short showers with lukewarm (not hot) water, and don’t take long baths either!
- Use unscented soap, and stick to unscented laundry detergent
- Wear clothing that is soft, lightweight, and breathable (like cotton). Wool and other scratchy stuff is not great.
- Keep your fingernails trimmed to avoid scratching damaging the skin.
- Use a humidifier in dry climate or winter.

Identify and avoid personal triggers. At our centres we do a lot of allergy testing to help patients understand what might be driving their flair ups.





### **8. Diet and Eczema**

Not everyone who suffers from eczema will suffer from a food allergy, but a lot of people already have a food allergy, and know that they get a flare-up from certain foods. The more prominent food allergens are dairy, eggs, soy, and all nuts. 

- If food might be a problem for you, reach out to a professional instead of removing dietary groups on your own.
- If you believe food may be triggering you, reach out to an allergy specialist. 
- We can help do the food sensitive testing for you and organise an elimination diet.





### **When to See A Specialist**

If you have eczema that is disrupting your sleep, your work, or your self esteem, or you have tried a number of over the counter products with no relief, it may be time to see a doctor. Our team at Allergy, Asthma and Sinus Centers complete full evaluations and develop treatment plans specific for you. 

We combine skin care recommendations with allergy testing, and the latest treatment options to help each patient find relief. We are there to support you every step of the way as you tackle this condition whether it is mild eczema or more complex.
