Sinusitis is when the lining of your sinuses becomes swollen or inflamed. These air-filled spaces behind your nose, forehead, and cheeks can get blocked by mucus. This can lead to pain, infection, and difficulty breathing through your nose. Sinusitis can be short-term (acute) or long-lasting (chronic).

### Blocked or Stuffy Nose

A blocked or stuffy nose is one of the most common symptoms of sinusitis. You may find it hard to breathe through your nose, and it can feel swollen or heavy. This blockage often affects your sleep and can make your voice sound different. Breathing through your mouth might become necessary.

### Facial Pain or Pressure

Sinusitis often causes pain or pressure in the face. You might feel this around your eyes, forehead, cheeks, or the bridge of your nose. The pain can feel worse when bending over or moving quickly. It can feel like a dull ache or sharp discomfort. This symptom may even mimic a headache.

### Thick Nasal Discharge

With sinusitis, mucus becomes thick and discoloured. Instead of a clear runny nose like with a cold, you may see yellow or green mucus. It can come out through the nose or run down the back of your throat—called postnasal drip. This often causes coughing, sore throat, and bad breath.

### Reduced or Lost Sense of Smell

Your sense of smell may fade or disappear during sinusitis. Swollen tissues stop scents from reaching your nose properly. This affects your taste too—food may seem bland or flavourless. Some people can’t smell strong scents like perfume or coffee. This usually returns once the sinuses clear up.

### Other Possible Symptoms

While those four are the main signs, others may also appear. These include coughing, tiredness, fever, earache, and swelling around the eyes. Symptoms can be worse in the morning or after lying down. If they last more than 10 days or worsen, it may be a bacterial infection needing treatment.

### When to See a GP

If your symptoms last longer than a week, get worse, or return often, it’s time to see a GP. They can find out if it’s a viral or bacterial cause and provide the right care. Sometimes you may need nasal sprays, antibiotics, or allergy treatment, depending on the reason.

### Tips to Ease Sinusitis Symptoms at Home

There are several ways to feel better at home:

- Place a warm towel over your face to relieve pressure
- Use saline nasal sprays to flush out mucus
- Stay well hydrated to thin the mucus
- Sleep with your head raised to help drainage
- Use a humidifier if your home is dry

### Conclusion

Sinusitis can make you feel quite unwell. But by knowing the four main symptoms—blocked nose, facial pain, thick discharge, and lost sense of smell—you can spot it early. With simple care and advice from a GP when needed, most people recover quickly and easily.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **1. How long does sinusitis usually last?**

Acute sinusitis often lasts 7–10 days, while chronic sinusitis can persist for 12 weeks or more. If symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a week, it’s best to seek medical advice.

### **2. Can allergies cause sinusitis?**

Yes, allergies like hay fever can trigger sinus inflammation. This swelling can block drainage and lead to sinus infections. Managing allergies properly can help prevent recurring sinusitis.

### **3. Is sinusitis contagious?**

Sinusitis itself isn’t contagious, but the cold or virus that leads to it can be. Good hygiene and avoiding close contact with infected individuals can help reduce your risk.

### **4. Can sinusitis go away on its own?**

Yes, mild cases of viral sinusitis often clear up without treatment. Rest, hydration, and nasal rinses can help. If symptoms last over 10 days, medical treatment may be needed.

### **5. What foods should I avoid with sinusitis?**

Avoid dairy, sugary foods, and processed items, as they may increase mucus. Spicy foods, on the other hand, can help open nasal passages and ease sinus pressure.
