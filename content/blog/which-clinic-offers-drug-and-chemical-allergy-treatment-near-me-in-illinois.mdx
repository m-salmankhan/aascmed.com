[**Allergy, Asthma and Sinus Centers**](https://www.aascmed.com/) offer trusted care for people across Illinois who deal with drug and chemical allergies.

In this article, you will learn how these allergies work, why testing matters, and how to choose the right clinic near you.

## **Understanding Drug and Chemical Allergies**

Drug and chemical allergies happen when your immune system reacts too strongly to a substance. Your body sees the drug or chemical as a threat. Because of that, it fights back. This leads to symptoms that can feel sudden or confusing.

Common signs include:

- Rash
- Itchy skin
- Swelling
- Sneezing
- Red eyes
- Trouble breathing
- Dizziness

Some reactions start fast. Others take time. Either way, you need a clinic that knows how to diagnose allergies correctly. **Allergy, Asthma and Sinus Centers** help you understand what your body reacts to and which treatments keep you safe.

### **Why Testing Is Important**

Testing is one of the best steps you can take. You learn exactly what caused your reaction. Without testing, you may avoid medicines for no reason. You may also use products that trigger your symptoms. Because of this, testing protects your health.

Testing also helps your doctor create a plan that fits your life. You learn what to avoid and what is safe. As a result, your future health visits become easier and safer.

## **Types of Drug and Chemical Allergy Tests**

Different tests help find what triggers your reaction. **Allergy, Asthma and Sinus Centers** offer several accurate testing options. Your doctor chooses the best one based on your symptoms and medical history.

### **Skin Testing**

Skin tests help find quick reactions. A small amount of the drug or chemical goes on your skin. Then the skin is lightly scratched. If the area turns red or swollen, your body may be reacting to that substance.

### **Patch Testing**

Patch testing checks for slow reactions. A small patch with the chemical is placed on your back. You keep it on for up to two days. After that, the clinic checks the area. This test is helpful for allergies from soaps, lotions, makeup, and cleaning products.

### **Blood Testing**

Blood tests check for allergy markers. This is helpful for people who cannot do skin tests. It also helps check allergies that may cause stronger reactions.

### **Drug Challenge Testing**

A drug challenge test happens in the clinic. You take a tiny dose of the medicine under close supervision. The doctor watches you carefully. Because of that, this test is safe and gives very clear answers.
