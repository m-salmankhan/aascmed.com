It is also very much genetic. This is why being aware of the personal triggers and keeping them at bay is a necessary element of taking care of the condition.

However early termination of the treatment may lead to the redevelopment of more eczema. In most cases, even after the relief of the symptoms, routine treatment should be upheld, such as the habit of moisturizing and triggering avoidance.

In our **Eczema Crest Hill** centre, the patients get to be informed on how to take care of their skin even after the treatment is over. This entails knowledge of hypoallergenic products, establishing a regular routine of skin care, and being on the lookout for the initial symptoms of a flare-up.

Follow-ups are essential for this reason. Patients also cooperate with the staff of Allergy, Asthma, and Sinus Centers to change the procedures in this way, as well as define other possibilities in case of the symptoms' persistence.
