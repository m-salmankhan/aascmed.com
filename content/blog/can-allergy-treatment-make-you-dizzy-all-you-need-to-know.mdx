Allergy treatments are commonly used to help manage symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. These treatments can include antihistamines, nasal sprays, and immunotherapy. While most people find relief from their symptoms, some may experience side effects, including dizziness. But why does this happen, and what can you do about it? This article explains the connection between allergy treatments and dizziness.

### What Causes Dizziness During Allergy Treatment?

Dizziness can be a result of various factors. In the case of allergy treatments, it can be caused by the medication itself, the underlying allergy symptoms, or other unrelated health issues.

#### Medication Side Effects

Some allergy medications, particularly antihistamines, can cause dizziness as a side effect. Older antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are more likely to cause this feeling. They can affect the central nervous system and lead to drowsiness or lightheadedness. Newer antihistamines tend to have fewer side effects but may still cause dizziness in some people.

#### Dehydration

Allergies often lead to nasal congestion, which can cause your sinuses to feel blocked. If your sinuses are blocked for long periods, it may lead to dehydration. When you become dehydrated, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded. If your allergy treatment doesn’t address dehydration, it could make the dizziness worse.

#### Blood Pressure Changes

Some allergy medications, especially decongestants, can affect your blood pressure. If you have low or high blood pressure, certain treatments may cause a drop or rise in your blood pressure, leading to dizziness. Always consult your doctor before using decongestants if you have blood pressure issues.

### Common Allergy Treatments That May Cause Dizziness

#### Antihistamines

Antihistamines are often used to treat common allergy symptoms like sneezing and itching. While they can be effective, older antihistamines, like Benadryl, can cause drowsiness and dizziness. They block the histamine receptors in your body, which helps reduce allergy symptoms but may also interfere with your balance.

#### Decongestants

Decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, are used to reduce nasal congestion. However, they can cause dizziness, especially when used for long periods. This is because they can narrow the blood vessels in the nasal passages, which may impact blood flow and lead to dizziness.

#### Nasal Sprays

Nasal sprays, such as those containing steroids, are often used to relieve inflammation in the nasal passages. Though they are generally safe, overuse of nasal sprays can cause side effects like dizziness, headaches, and a dry throat.

#### Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy involves allergy shots or tablets that help build your immunity to allergens over time. While this treatment is highly effective, it can sometimes lead to side effects such as dizziness, particularly after the injection.

### What to Do if You Feel Dizzy During Allergy Treatment

If you experience dizziness while undergoing allergy treatment, here are some steps you can take:

#### Take a Break

If you’re feeling dizzy, sit down and rest until the feeling passes. Avoid standing up too quickly, as this can make dizziness worse.

#### Stay Hydrated

Drink plenty of water to ensure that your body stays hydrated. Dehydration can make dizziness worse, especially during allergy season.

#### Switch Medications

If you think your dizziness is linked to your allergy medication, talk to your doctor. They may recommend a different medication that has fewer side effects. There are non-drowsy antihistamines available, which may be a better option for you.

#### Monitor Your Blood Pressure

If you suspect your dizziness is due to blood pressure changes, check with your healthcare provider. They may recommend a different treatment or adjust your dosage to help manage your blood pressure more effectively.

### When to Seek Medical Help

If your dizziness persists or worsens, it is important to seek medical attention. While dizziness is a common side effect of some allergy treatments, it could also be a sign of a more serious issue. If you experience dizziness along with other symptoms, such as fainting, chest pain, or shortness of breath, contact a healthcare professional immediately.
