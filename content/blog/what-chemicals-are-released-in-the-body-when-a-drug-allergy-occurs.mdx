Drug allergies happen when your immune system overreacts to a medication that your body doesn’t like. This can cause different symptoms, ranging from mild itching to severe problems like trouble breathing. But what exactly happens inside your body when this happens? Let’s look at the chemicals that are released and how they cause the symptoms of a [**drug allergy**](https://www.aascmed.com/conditions/drug-and-chemical-allergies/).

### Understanding Drug Allergies

When you take a medication, your immune system normally recognises it as harmless. However, in some people, the immune system mistakenly sees the drug as a harmful substance. This leads to an allergic reaction. The body releases chemicals as part of its defence, which causes inflammation and other symptoms.

### The Role of Histamine

One of the first chemicals that the body releases during an allergic reaction is **histamine**. Histamine is a chemical that helps your body defend itself from harmful substances. It is involved in the immune response and is found in many cells, especially in your skin, lungs, and stomach. When your immune system detects a drug as a threat, histamine is released.

Histamine causes blood vessels to expand, which can lead to symptoms like swelling, redness, and itching. This is why your skin may start to itch or become swollen when you have a drug allergy.

### Immunoglobulin E (IgE)

Another important chemical involved in drug allergies is **IgE**, a type of antibody. IgE is produced by the immune system in response to allergens like certain drugs. When IgE detects a drug as a potential threat, it triggers other immune cells to release histamine and other chemicals.

IgE’s role in a drug allergy is crucial, as it helps the immune system identify and respond to the drug. However, in some people, IgE may be overly sensitive and react even to harmless drugs, leading to allergic reactions.

### Cytokines and Their Effects

In addition to histamine, **cytokines** are also released during an allergic reaction. Cytokines are small proteins that help to regulate the immune system. They play a key role in inflammation and can make the body more sensitive to the drug.

Cytokines signal other cells to come to the site of the allergic reaction. These cells can cause additional inflammation, making symptoms like swelling, redness, and pain worse.

There are different types of cytokines, and some are responsible for causing the body to have a more severe allergic response. This is why some people experience more intense allergic reactions than others when they take the same medication.

### Leukotrienes and Their Impact

**Leukotrienes** are another group of chemicals released during a drug allergy. These chemicals are involved in the body’s inflammatory response. Leukotrienes can cause tightening of the airways, making it harder to breathe. This is why some people may experience symptoms like wheezing or difficulty breathing during a drug allergy.

Leukotrienes are often associated with asthma and can be triggered by allergic reactions to drugs. They increase the production of mucus and cause the muscles around the airways to contract, leading to breathing difficulties.

### Prostaglandins and Inflammation

**Prostaglandins** are chemicals that help the body control inflammation. They are involved in the body’s response to injury or infection. When you have a drug allergy, prostaglandins are released to help protect your body. However, they also cause the blood vessels to dilate, which leads to symptoms like swelling and pain.

Prostaglandins can also contribute to fever and redness during an allergic reaction. This is why some people may develop a rash or fever when they are allergic to a drug.

### How the Body Responds

When these chemicals are released, they work together to create the symptoms of a drug allergy. In some cases, these symptoms may be mild and include things like a rash, itching, or swelling. However, in more severe cases, the immune system’s response can cause life-threatening symptoms such as difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis, which is a severe, whole-body allergic reaction.

### The Importance of Early Recognition

It is important to recognise the signs of a drug allergy early on. Symptoms like itching, redness, swelling, or difficulty breathing may indicate that your body is releasing these chemicals in response to a drug. If you experience any of these symptoms, it is essential to stop taking the medication and seek medical attention immediately.

### Conclusion

When you have a drug allergy, your body releases a variety of chemicals, including histamine, IgE, cytokines, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. These chemicals work together to cause inflammation and other allergic symptoms. Understanding what happens inside the body during a drug allergy can help you recognise the signs and seek medical help before the symptoms get worse. If you are unsure whether a medication is causing an allergic reaction, always consult your doctor or pharmacist to avoid further complications.
