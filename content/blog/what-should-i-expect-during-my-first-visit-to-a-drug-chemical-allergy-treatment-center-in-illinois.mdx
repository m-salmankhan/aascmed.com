### **Reviewing Your Medical History**

Your health history is important. So your provider reviews it with care. You talk about past reactions, current medicines, and any long-term health conditions. This step is very helpful because it explains why your body reacts in certain ways.

You also talk about family history. Many allergies run in families. When you share this information, the center understands your risks better. This makes the next steps easier and more accurate.

### **Discussing Your Symptoms in Detail**

Next, you describe your symptoms. You talk about when they started and how strong they feel. You also mention how long they last. This helps the team understand your triggers.

You may also talk about where you work or what products you use at home. Many people react to everyday items like detergents, lotions, or cleaning supplies. When you share this, the team learns a lot about your environment. And this leads to better testing and better treatment.

### **Getting Ready for Allergy Testing**

### **Skin Testing for Drug and Chemical Allergies**

Skin testing is a common step. It is simple and fast. The specialist places small drops on your skin. Then, they make tiny scratches so the body reacts. You may feel a slight tickle. However, it is safe and easy.

After a few minutes, the team checks your skin. If there is redness or swelling, this means there may be an allergy. This process helps the provider learn which products or medicines cause problems for you.

### **Blood Tests When Needed**

Sometimes skin tests do not give enough answers. If this happens, you may need a blood test. This test checks your immune system. It shows how your body reacts to certain chemicals or drugs.

Blood tests are quick and safe. The results help the provider build a strong treatment plan. With this extra information, you get better long-term care.

After testing, the team reviews your results. They explain everything in simple words. You learn what you reacted to and how serious it is. This step is important because it helps you understand your body.

Then, the provider shares options for treatment. They talk about changes you can make at home, at work, or in daily life. These small steps often lead to big improvements.

At Allergy, Asthma and Sinus Centers, the team builds a plan that fits your life. They help you understand how to use your medicine. They guide you on how to avoid triggers. And they check on you over time to make sure you feel better.
