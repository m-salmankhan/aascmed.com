A sinus infection, also called sinusitis, happens when the sinuses become swollen and filled with fluid. This swelling blocks the normal flow of mucus. As a result, bacteria, viruses, or fungi can grow and cause infection. Sinus infections can be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). You may feel pressure in your cheeks or forehead, a blocked or runny nose, and pain around your eyes. Some people also feel tired or have a cough.

### What Causes a Sinus Infection?

Many things can cause a sinus infection. The most common cause is a virus, such as the one that causes the common cold. Sometimes, bacteria or fungi can also lead to infection. Other triggers include:

- Allergies
- Nasal polyps (small growths in the nose)
- A deviated septum (a crooked nasal passage)
- Asthma
- A weak immune system
If your symptoms last longer than ten days or come back often, it may be a sign of something more serious.

### How Do You Know If It’s Sinusitis?

Some signs of sinusitis are:

- Blocked or stuffy nose
- Yellow or green mucus
- Pain or pressure in the face
- Headache
- Fever
- Tiredness
- Toothache
- Bad breath
These symptoms can seem like a cold or allergy. But if the facial pain is strong, or the mucus is thick and coloured, it’s more likely to be sinusitis.

### Can Sinus Infections Go Away on Their Own?

Yes, mild sinus infections often get better without treatment. Viral infections usually improve within 7 to 10 days. During this time, you can manage symptoms at home. However, if symptoms don’t improve or get worse, it’s time to speak with a healthcare provider. You may have a bacterial infection that needs medication.

### Home Treatments for Sinus Infections

For most mild cases, self-care can help ease symptoms. Here are some tips:

**Rest**
Get plenty of sleep to help your body heal.

**Stay hydrated**
Drink lots of water. This helps thin the mucus and keeps it draining.

**Use a warm compress**
Apply a warm cloth over your cheeks and forehead. This can ease pain and pressure.

**Try steam**
Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or take a hot shower. It helps open the sinuses and makes mucus drain more easily.

**Rinse your nose**
Use a saline spray or a neti pot to flush out the nose. This clears out mucus and germs.

### Over-the-Counter Medications

Some pharmacy medicines can help relieve symptoms, including:

**Pain relievers:** Paracetamol or ibuprofen can reduce fever and ease headaches.
**Decongestants:** These help shrink swollen nasal tissues. Use them for no more than three days to avoid rebound congestion.
**Nasal sprays:** Steroid sprays can reduce inflammation in the nose. They’re safe for longer use but should be used as directed.

### When Are Antibiotics Needed?

Antibiotics only help if your sinus infection is caused by bacteria. They do not work for viral infections. A doctor may suggest antibiotics if:

- Symptoms last more than 10 days
- You feel better, then suddenly worse again
- Your facial pain is severe
- There is a high fever
Always finish the full course if antibiotics are prescribed.

### Treating Long-Term or Chronic Sinusitis

If you have sinus infections that keep coming back or last more than 12 weeks, it may be chronic sinusitis. Treatment depends on the cause. Options include:

- Steroid nasal sprays
- Allergy medicines
- Antihistamines
- A nasal rinse routine
- Referral to an ENT specialist for further tests
- Surgery, in rare cases, to correct structural problems

### Can Allergies Cause Sinus Infections?

Yes. Allergies like hay fever can lead to sinus infections. They cause nasal tissues to swell, which blocks the sinuses. If you have frequent allergy symptoms, managing them may reduce your risk of sinusitis.

Your doctor may suggest:

- Daily antihistamines
- Nasal steroid sprays
- Allergy tests
- Immunotherapy (allergy shots or drops)

### When to See a Doctor

Most sinus infections are mild and go away with rest and care. But see a doctor if:

- You have a high fever
- Pain gets worse
- Symptoms last more than 10 days
- You get sinus infections often
- Your vision changes
- You feel very drowsy or confused
These could be signs of a more serious condition that needs quick treatment.

### Conclusion

Sinus infections are common and often mild. Rest, steam, and over-the-counter medicines can help. If the infection is bacterial or lasts longer than usual, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Long-term sinus problems may need specialist care. The key is knowing when to treat at home and when to seek help.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **1. How do I know if my sinus infection is viral or bacterial?**


Viral sinus infections usually improve within 7–10 days. If your symptoms last longer, get worse after feeling better, or include facial pain and high fever, it could be bacterial. A doctor can help confirm the cause and recommend the right treatment.

### **2. Can I fly with a sinus infection?**


It’s best to avoid flying with a sinus infection, especially if you feel pressure or pain. Cabin pressure changes can make symptoms worse. If you must travel, use a decongestant spray before the flight and stay well hydrated.

### **3. Do sinus infections always cause a fever?**


No, not all sinus infections cause fever. Many people experience facial pressure, nasal congestion, and mucus without a raised temperature. A fever is more common in bacterial infections, but it’s not a guaranteed sign.

### **4. Is it safe to use nasal sprays every day?**


Steroid nasal sprays can be used daily as directed by a doctor. However, decongestant sprays should only be used for up to three days. Overuse may lead to rebound congestion and make your symptoms worse.

### **5. Can diet affect sinus health?**


Yes, a balanced diet supports the immune system, which helps fight infections. Staying hydrated and limiting dairy (for some people) may reduce mucus build-up. Anti-inflammatory foods like leafy greens, garlic, and citrus can also support sinus health.
