    question: How is immunotherapy different from regular allergy treatments?
    answer: >
      Immunotherapy stands out from traditional allergy treatments because it
      aims for long-term relief rather than just masking symptoms. It helps your
      body gradually get used to allergens, making it a more effective way to
      manage allergies and asthma without needing constant medication.
