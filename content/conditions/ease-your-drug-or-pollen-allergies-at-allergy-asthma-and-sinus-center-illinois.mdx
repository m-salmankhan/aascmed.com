    question: How is immunotherapy different from regular allergy treatments?
    answer: >
      Immunotherapy stands out from traditional allergy treatments because it
      aims for long-term relief rather than just masking symptoms. It helps your
      body gradually get used to allergens, making it a more effective way to
      manage allergies and asthma without needing constant medication.

    answer: >
      Serious allergic reactions, like anaphylaxis, are very rare with
      sublingual immunotherapy, and there have been no reported deaths from this
      treatment. While mild to moderate allergic reactions can happen, they are
      usually manageable. Overall, immunotherapy is considered a safe option for
      treating allergies.

      You may start to see results from allergy immunotherapy in 3 to 12 months.
      Treatment begins with small doses that increase over time, followed by
      regular doses. Everyone's response is different, so some may notice
      changes sooner than others.

## Immunotherapy: A New Way to Manage Allergies

Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment that helps your body fight allergies by training your immune system. It works by gradually exposing you to small amounts of allergens, allowing your body to build tolerance over time. This means fewer allergy symptoms such as sneezing and itching. You will be able to enjoy life without constant discomfort.

How Does Ultra Rush Immunotherapy Work?

Ultra Rush-Immunotherapy helps you to achieve lasting results whereas traditional allergy shots lasts for only  3-5 years. And here's how it all works:

### Step 1: Assessment

We shall begin by assessing your allergies and medical history to create an individualized treatment plan suitable for you.

### Step 2: First Dose

In the first treatment sessions, you are given some small amounts of allergens. This will help your body to build tolerance against these drugs and substances triggering allergies.

### Step 3: Building Immunity

You will continue to receive doses for several weeks. This will allow your immune system to gradually be exposed and, thus, learn to react less vigorously to allergens.
