## Food Allergy Symptoms, Diagnosis & Treatment

At [Asthma, Allergy and Sinus Center](/) we offer a wide range of services for a variety of allergies and related conditions, including:

**Food Allergies:** Food allergies occur when your immune system wrongly identifies a certain food as harmful and launches an unnecessary response. Common food allergies include those to peanuts, milk, eggs, and shellfish. Symptoms can range from mild reactions like itching or hives, to severe ones like anaphylaxis. Managing a food allergy usually involves strict avoidance of the allergen and having emergency medication available, such as an auto-injectable epinephrine.

**Anaphylaxis:** Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen. It often causes breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and can be fatal if not treated immediately. Common triggers include certain foods, some medications, insect venom, and latex. Prompt administration of epinephrine is crucial during an anaphylactic reaction.

**Eosinophilic Esophagitis:** Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune system disease where a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the lining of the esophagus. This build-up, often triggered by foods such as milk, eggs, wheat, soy, nuts, causes inflammation and can lead to difficulties in swallowing and food getting stuck. Management typically involves dietary changes and medication to reduce eosinophils in the esophagus.

**Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES):** FPIES is a severe condition causing inflammation of the stomach and small intestine in response to ingesting certain foods. Common triggers are milk and soy, but any food can cause FPIES. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Management usually involves identifying and avoiding trigger foods.

**Food Intolerances:** Unlike food allergies, which involve the immune system, food intolerances generally occur when your body cannot properly digest a certain food. Lactose intolerance and gluten sensitivity are common examples. Symptoms can include bloating, gas, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Management typically involves avoiding or reducing intake of problematic foods.

**Drug Allergies:** [Drug Allergies](/conditions/drug-chemical-allergy/) occur when the immune system reacts to a medication. Symptoms can range from mild (like a rash) to severe (anaphylaxis). Common medications that cause allergic reactions include penicillin and related antibiotics. If you have a drug allergy, alternative medications are usually identified and used.

**Our team uses the latest diagnostic techniques and treatments to manage your allergies, including:**

- **Food, oral immunotherapy and desensitisation:** A progressive dosage of real food to increase the threshold of tolerated doses
- **Food Challenges:** A procedure used to definitively diagnose or rule out a food allergy.
- **Drug Challenges:** A tool used to confirm or dismiss drug allergies under close supervision.
- **Venom Allergy Immunotherapy:** Also known as desensitization, this therapy aims to reduce your sensitivity to insect venom.
- **Aspirin Challenges and Aspirin Desensitization:** These services help determine if you're allergic to aspirin and, if so, reduce your sensitivity.
- **Atopy Patch Test:** A diagnostic tool used to identify substances causing skin allergies.
- **Surgical Metal Panel Patch Test:** This test identifies whether you're allergic to certain metals, which is crucial information for anyone planning to undergo surgery.
