## Nose Allergy Treatments

There are a number of options for treating nasal allergies. We will provide advice on how best to avoid these allergens and recommend products that are worth buying (and help you avoid those that aren't). For some cases, we may also consider treatments such as:

- **Traditional Immunotherapy** - Builds up with allergy shots given on a weekly basis before escalating to a goal of once-monthly injections for 3–5 years. You can expect 60%–80% improvement in symptoms and possibly a cure in the best-case scenario.

However, with RUSH immunotherapy, we can build you up to monthly shots in one month. However, with RUSH immunotherapy, we can four month of injections in one day.
- **ULTRA RUSH Immunotherapy** - Injections are given under ultrasound guidance directly into a lymph node in the groin area. There are three injections given one month apart, equivalent to 3–5 years of traditional immunotherapy.
- **Oral Allergy Immunotherapy Tablets** - These are FDA-approved tablets that can build resistance to grass, ragweed, and dust mite (SLIT) allergies.
