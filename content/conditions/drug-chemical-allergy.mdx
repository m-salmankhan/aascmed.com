    question: How is immunotherapy different from regular allergy treatments?
    answer: >
      Immunotherapy stands out from traditional allergy treatments because it
      aims for long-term relief rather than just masking symptoms. It helps your
      body gradually get used to allergens, making it a more effective way to
      manage allergies and asthma without needing constant medication.

    answer: >
      Serious allergic reactions, like anaphylaxis, are very rare with
      sublingual immunotherapy, and there have been no reported deaths from this
      treatment. While mild to moderate allergic reactions can happen, they are
      usually manageable. Overall, immunotherapy is considered a safe option for
      treating allergies.
    question: How safe is immunotherapy for allergies?
  - question_heading_level: "3"
    answer: >
      You may start to see results from allergy immunotherapy in 3 to 12 months.
      Treatment begins with small doses that increase over time, followed by
      regular doses. Everyone's response is different, so some may notice
      changes sooner than others.
    question: How quickly will I see results from immunotherapy?
  - answer: >
      Immunotherapy is usually safe for most people with allergies, but you need
      to have a consultation first. Specialists will look at your medical
      history to see if this treatment is the best choice for you.
