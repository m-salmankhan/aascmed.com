|\|Dear Patients and Families,<br />After 40 years in medicine, I have decided it’s time to retire.<br />It has been a true privilege and honor to be entrusted by you with personal concerns and allow me to try and figure out the best way to help. While I greatly enjoyed the challenges medicine brought, it was meeting all of you individually, each with your unique story and personality that enriched my days at work. That has always been the best part of being a physician for me.<br />I will be working through mid-March 2025. As some of you may know, we have had problems accessing the Western Springs office and that is still up in the air at this time. In the meantime, for those of you who would like to have a visit with me prior to my retirement, I will be in Bolingbrook, approximately 15 minutes from the Western Springs office. We are making arrangements for office space in Willowbrook as well hopefully to be ready by next week. Phone or video visits are also available. Please call to schedule. Our new permanent location will be at 6412 Joliet Rd in Countryside hopefully by April.<br />Once I leave, I know you will be in excellent hands with Dr. Syed Rizvi, Dr. Maaz Mohiuddin, and the staff at Allergy Asthma & Sinus Centers.<br />Wherever your lives journey forward, I wish you the very best in what lies ahead.<br />Thank you so very much,Renee Lantner\|<br />\|---\|<br />|
