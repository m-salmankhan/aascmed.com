Dear Patients of AASC,

Amid the concerns of COVID-19, we are taking special precautions to adhere to social distancing recommendations while providing high-quality care.

There have not been any recommendations for asthmatics during the current pandemic. We recommend compliance with medications, frequent hand washing, and social distancing.

Our offices will be deep cleaned and reopened on March 19th. The following changes will be implemented and may be modified depending on the course of the pandemic.

Patients will be screened for fever, cough, sore throat, travel history, and known contacts of COVID-19 patients and if positive will be asked to have their appointment done via telehealth or telephone.
Minors should be accompanied by 1 parent, while siblings should wait in the car with the other parent when possible. Only those who will be receiving care should enter the office.
For immunotherapy patients, patients will wait in their cars in the parking lot and check-in after 30 minutes before leaving the office.
The situation is fluid and subject to change and we will keep the health of our patients our top priority.

Be well,

Dr. Maaz
