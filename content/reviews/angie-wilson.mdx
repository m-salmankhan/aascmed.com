This is my daughter’s Allergy Office. I can’t give enough praise when it comes to patient care and customer service. My daughter sees Adriana Muñoz, PA. Adriana is very thorough when it comes to educating her patients in Allergies and Asthma! Dr Maaz Mohiuddin is very passionate about empowering patients to take charge of their Allergies and Asthma! Dr Mohiuddin takes an active role in educating patients in their disease state, medications and device technique. The staff is also amazing! Jasmine is one of the team members who works the front desk. She always greets patients with a positive attitude and a smile! She goes above and beyond to help patients with their needs/concerns! I highly recommend Allergy Asthma and Sinus Center if you or your family are in search for an Allergy/Asthma Group!
