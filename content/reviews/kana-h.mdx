Our visit exceeded our expectations. Dr. took his time to speak with my daughter and us (parents) to ensure everyone understood what was being treated plus we worked together to form a follow up plan. It's not often you find a physician who is incredibly knowlegeable and amazing with patients (bedside manner). I highly recommend Dr. Maaz!
