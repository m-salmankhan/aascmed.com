Given the current risks associated with social interactions due to Covid-19, we have now started offering telehealth services for those who do not wish to attend in-person appointments. We strongly recommend that anyone in particularly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or those with existing respiratory problems opt for telehealth services.

We would also once again like to highlight that for everyone who does choose to attend in-person appointments, we will require masks to be worn and social distancing measures will be observed.

We appreciate your cooperation,

The Allergy, Asthma and Sinus Centers Team
