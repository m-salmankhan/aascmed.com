## Respiratory Problems Diagnosis & Management.

Our suite of services is designed to provide comprehensive care for your respiratory health. They include:

- **Body Plethysmography:** An advanced diagnostic test that measures your lung volume and capacity. It helps us understand how well your lungs are functioning and is crucial for diagnosing various lung disorders.
- **Spirometry:** A simple test to measure how much and how quickly you can move air out of your lungs. It’s essential for diagnosing and monitoring conditions like asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
- **Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) Test:** This non-invasive test measures the level of nitric oxide in your breath, which can be a sign of inflammation in the lungs. It’s a critical tool for diagnosing and managing asthma.
- **Exercise Challenge:** This test assesses how exercise affects your breathing. It helps diagnose exercise-induced asthma, a condition where physical exertion triggers asthma symptoms.
- **Rhinolaryngoscopy:** An advanced diagnostic procedure to examine the nose and throat. It can help identify issues such as nasal blockages or abnormalities in the larynx that may be affecting your breathing.
- **Biologic Injections (Xolair, Nucala, Fasenra):** These innovative therapies can provide relief for patients with severe asthma by targeting and reducing specific immune responses causing asthma symptoms.
- **Breathing Exercises for Vocal Cord Dysfunction:** Our therapists will guide you through specialized exercises designed to help manage vocal cord dysfunction, a condition where the vocal cords close instead of open when breathing.
